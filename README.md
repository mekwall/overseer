# overseer
An experimental cluster manager for nodejs

## Features

* Automatic (re)forking of workers based on CPU cores
* Graceful restart and shutdown of workers
* Rolling restarts so there's no downtime
* Unifying `console` output to master process
* Beautiful logging to stdout that makes sense
* Watch for file system changes and restart/inform workers

## Installation

    npm install -g overseer

## Basic usage

### CLI

    overseer -f 4 app
    
The above will fork 4 workers running `app.js` in the current directory.

### Programmatic

    require('overseer')('app.js', {
        watch: true
    }).run();
    
The above will fork as many workers as there are CPU cores and restart/inform these on any file system changes.

## Wishlist

* Customizable file system watcher
* Deeper wrapping (sandboxing?) of worker processes
* Ability to override the port and host used when listening
* Customizable logging
* Alternative for `forever`
* Script to run as deamon
* Plugin system
